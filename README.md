Find and Delete Duplicate files

This is a working application that can find duplicate files in a given folder.

To run the application:
call java -jar <Jar File Name>
Or
Simply double click if the jar is cnfigured to run with Java.

I invite Contributors to add new features/improve the project and make it a working File Organizer.

Future Goals:

1) Apply Filters to find duplicates in specified type of files.
